## Users

**Dual audience, equal weight:**

1. **Existing PCYC members** — Brothers, Sisters, and Friends within the Philippine Christadelphian community who participate in youth circle events, order fundraising merchandise, and stay connected across ecclesias. They log in, register for camps, place merch orders, and upload GCash/PalawanPay payment receipts.

2. **Prospective visitors and friends** — People curious about the Christadelphian faith or looking for a Philippine youth fellowship community. They browse publicly, learn about PCYC's mission and history, view upcoming events, and may register as a Friend to participate.

**Admins** — PCYC leadership managing events, merchandise inventory, payment receipt verification, and member roles through an integrated admin panel.

## Product Purpose

PCYC Space is the digital home of the Philippine Christadelphian Youth Circle — the only Christadelphian youth circle in the Philippines. It serves three core functions:

1. **Inform & welcome** — Present PCYC's mission, history, leadership, and faith to both existing members and newcomers.
2. **Organize & connect** — Publish and manage youth events (bible camps, fellowship gatherings, study circles) with online registration.
3. **Fund & sustain** — Sell branded merchandise (shirts, hoodies, tote bags, stickers) with a manual payment verification flow (GCash, Maya, PalawanPay screenshot receipts) to raise funds at zero transaction cost.

Success means the site is the first place members check for PCYC updates and the first thing a curious visitor finds when looking for Christadelphian youth community in the Philippines.

## Positioning

PCYC is the sole Christadelphian youth circle in the Philippines — unique by definition. The site does not compete with other youth fellowships; it serves as the canonical digital presence for a community that currently lacks one.

## Operating Context

- Members are spread across multiple Philippine ecclesias (Manila, Davao, Cebu, etc.)
- Events are primarily in-person camps and gatherings; the site handles promotion and registration, not the event itself
- Merch orders use manual payment: buyer sends funds via GCash/Maya/PalawanPay → uploads receipt screenshot → admin verifies and fulfills
- Communication supplements, not replaces, existing group chats and in-person fellowship
- Admin operations happen through the built-in dashboard, not a third-party CMS

## Capabilities and Constraints

**Confirmed capabilities:**
- Public pages: landing, about/history, events listing and detail, merch catalog
- User auth: registration with Brother/Sister/Friend designation, conditional baptism date, ecclesia affiliation
- Member portal: profile management, order history, receipt upload
- Admin dashboard: events CRUD, merch inventory, order/receipt verification queue, member management
- Manual payment flow with receipt screenshot upload to private Supabase Storage
- Transactional email via Resend (order confirmation, verification notices)

**Constraints:**
- Zero-cost operations on free tiers (Supabase, Vercel, Resend 100/day)
- No automated payment gateway yet (PayMongo integration deferred)
- No real-time chat or messaging — out of scope
- Philippine Peso (PHP) currency only

## Brand Commitments

- Existing PCYC logo and branding materials (to be provided by user)

- Name: "PCYC" / "Philippine Christadelphian Youth Circle"
- Tone: welcoming, faith-driven, youthful but grounded

## Evidence on Hand

- No live production site currently exists — this is the canonical first build
- Logo and brand assets exist but have not yet been provided to the repository
- No testimonials, case studies, or press coverage to reference
- Event history exists in community memory but has not been digitized

## Product Principles

1. **Welcoming first** — Every page should make a newcomer feel invited, not excluded by insider language.
2. **Zero-friction access** — Public content requires no login; registration is simple and respects the Brother/Sister/Friend identity.
3. **Zero-cost sustainability** — Architecture choices must keep operational costs at zero or near-zero on free tiers.
4. **Community, not commerce** — The merch store funds the mission; it should feel like fellowship, not a retail operation.
5. **Admin simplicity** — Volunteer admins should manage everything from one dashboard without technical knowledge.
